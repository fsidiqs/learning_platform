         '<p><strong>Master the Theory to Becoming a Good Programmer!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If youre looking to learn the theory that makes great programmers,&nbsp;youve come to the right place!&nbsp;This course is perfect for anyone interested in learning the fundamentals to Computer Science Theory.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>No Previous Experience Necessary!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Computer science and technology are often thought of as things only for "analytical minds". I believe however that technology and its theory are for everyone. So I designed this&nbsp;course to&nbsp;teach each topic in a variety of&nbsp;<strong>easy to digest</strong> ways. Through these multiple reinforcing steps, I believe anyone can follow along and succeed!&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Why is the Theory of Programming Important?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Understanding&nbsp;Computer Science theory is what sets apart&nbsp;<strong>Great programmers&nbsp;</strong>from average ones. Programming theory is something that transcends a single programming language. It gives you skills and techniques you can apply to any programming language you touch. Learning the theory behind programming is just as important, if not more important than learning a singular programming language like Java or C++.</p><p>Programming is all about problem solving. Analyzing a problem, and being able to figure out a way that a computer can help with that problem. Computer Science is the practice of this analysis process. It goes over the techniques and knowledge necessary to design efficient and sustainable code.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you want to begin setting yourself apart from the average programmers, this is the course for you!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Enroll Now and youll Learn:&nbsp;</strong><br></p><ul><li><p>Binary Number System</p></li><li><p>N Notation</p></li><li><p>Big O Notation</p></li><li><p>How to Analyze a Program</p></li><li><p>Arrays and&nbsp;their Advantages</p></li><li><p>Nodes and their Importance</p></li><li><p>Linked&nbsp;Lists and their Advantages and Implementations</p></li><li><p>Stacks implemented with Arrays and Linked&nbsp;Lists</p></li><li><p>Queues Implemented with Arrays and Linked Lists</p></li><li><p>Various Sorting Algorithms and Their Comparisions</p></li><li><p>Trees and Binary Search Trees</p></li><li><p>And Much Much More!&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>My&nbsp;Guarantee</strong></p><p>I am so confident you will enjoy this course, I offer a 100%&nbsp;30-day money-back guarantee through Udemy.&nbsp;If you are not happy with your purchase, I have no problem with giving your money back!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Are You Ready to Get Started?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I will be waiting for you inside the course!&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, this is an online course, so you can take it at your own pace.&nbsp;<em>Are you busy right now?&nbsp;</em>Thats okay.

Turkey is one of the few countries in the world that has been self sustaining, producing all its own food. Turkish cuisine traditionally is NOT spicy, except in the southeast part of the country, where preparations can reflect a hot Middle Eastern(Arabic) food influence. But now in evertwhere you are able to find restaurants that sell that kind of spicy dishes</p><p>Turks have a big diversity of vegetables and of course this reflects on the dishes.

I instantly purchased this course as soon as I saw it was released because I know Angela delivers the highest quality educational content possible. 100% recommend this course (as well as every other course she's created). Thank you Angela for helping me as I make a career pivot into becoming a hybrid UX designer/mobile developer!' - Jacob Pernell</p><p>'Angela is my favorite Udemy professor for coding courses. Her methods for building onto the material so that you're never progressing too fast or too slow make for a really engaging learning experience. She's thorough in her explanations, and uses fun projects to discuss the material. I had started a couple other Flutter courses before finding this one, and I've progressed more in 24hrs than I did in a week with the other courses. Would love an advanced Flutter course from Angela to tackle once I'm done with this one!' - Jerome Llouche</p><p><em>'You will not find a better teacher than Angela. She does a wonderful job of encouraging you to learn swift the right way. I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it,&nbsp;as it is the </em><strong><em>BEST programming class</em></strong><em> I've seen on anywhere and I've tried more than a few of them. If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store.' - Ian Hopjins</em></p><p><em>'SO GOOD!!!&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Retention rate is incredible</em></strong><em> because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5'</em> -&nbsp;Muhammad Ibrahim</p><p><em>'Angela is a </em><strong><em>spectacular</em></strong><em> teacher!'</em> -&nbsp;Marco Zanirato</p><p><em>'This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I</em><strong><em> realized how good this course</em></strong><em> was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept.' -&nbsp;Marc</em></p><p><em>'Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but </em><strong><em>Angela made me a pro</em></strong><em> in weeks.'</em> -&nbsp;Burak Tunçbilek</p><p><em>'IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of </em><strong><em>this course is built to make you learn, not just watch</em></strong><em> and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!'</em> -&nbsp;Eduard Khachian</p><p><strong>Are you trying to choose between all the different Flutter&nbsp;courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:</strong></p><p><em>I have revamped my expectation for what a</em><strong><em> 5 star course </em></strong><em>should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!</em> - Alberto L</p><p><em>'I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, </em><strong><em>deep and clear</em></strong><em>.' -&nbsp;Žan Fras</em></p><p><em>'I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the </em><strong><em>best explanation </em></strong><em>on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable.' -&nbsp;Bryan Pukanda</em></p><p><em>'I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which </em><strong><em>i did not want it to end</em></strong><em>. It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course.' - Arun Lakhera</em></p><p><em>'I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say 'just do this. You will see why later.' She goes into the </em><strong><em>reason for doing something</em></strong><em> before doing it.'</em> &nbsp;-&nbsp;Clyde Addison</p><p><br></p><p><strong>REMEMBER… \n  I'm so confident that you'll love this course that&nbsp;we're offering a FULL money back guarantee for&nbsp;30 days!

Of course it will be kept up-to-date in the future&nbsp;:-)</strong></p><p>---</p><p><strong>What's this course about?</strong></p><p>Learn React or dive deeper into it.&nbsp;Learn the theory, solve assignments, practice in demo projects and build one big application which is improved throughout the course:&nbsp;The Burger Builder!</p><p><strong>More details please!</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the <strong>major driver</strong> of modern web applications since it's the only programming language which runs in the browser and hence allows you to provide highly reactive apps. You'll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web.</p><p>But using JavaScript <strong>can be challenging</strong> - it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only.</p><p><strong>React to the rescue!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>React is all about components</strong> - basically custom HTML&nbsp;elements - with which you can quickly build amazing and powerful web apps. Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed.</p><p>Need to display a list of users in your app?&nbsp;It's as simple as creating a 'User'&nbsp;component and outputting it as often as needed.</p><p>This course will <strong>start at the very basics</strong> and explain what exactly React is and how you may use it (and for which kind of apps). Thereafter, we'll go all the way <strong>from basic to advanced</strong>. We'll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into React as well as popular libraries like react-router and Redux.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of the course, you can build amazing React (single page)&nbsp;applications!</p><p>A detailed list with the course content can be found below.</p><p><strong>Who's teaching you in this course?</strong></p><p>My name is Maximilian Schwarzmüller, I'm a freelance web developer and worked with React in many projects. I'm also a 5-star rated instructor here on Udemy. I&nbsp;cover React's most popular alternatives - Vue and Angular - as well as many other topics. I know what I'm talking about and I&nbsp;know where the pain points can be found.</p><p>It's my goal to get you started with React as quick as possible and ensure your success. But I don't just focus on students getting started. I want everyone to benefit from my courses, that's why we'll dive deeply into React and why I&nbsp;made sure to also share knowledge that's helpful to&nbsp;advanced React developers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is this course for you?</strong></p><p>This course is for you if ...</p><ul><li><p>...you're just getting started with frontend/&nbsp;JavaScript development and only got the JS&nbsp;basics set (no prior React or other framework experience is required!)</p></li><li><p>...you're experienced with Angular or Vue but want to dive into React</p></li><li><p>...know the React basics but want to refresh them and/ or dive deeper</p></li><li><p>...already worked quite a bit with React but want to dive deeper and see it all come together in a bigger app</p></li></ul><p><strong>What should you bring to succeed in that course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>HTML + CSS&nbsp;+ JavaScript knowledge is required. You don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set</p></li><li><p>NO&nbsp;advanced JavaScript knowledge is required, though you'll be able to move even quicker through the course if you know next-gen JavaScript features like ES6 Arrow functions.<strong> A short refresher about the most important next-gen features is provided in the course though.</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>What's inside the course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>The 'What', 'Why'&nbsp;and 'How'</p></li><li><p>React Basics (Base features, syntax and concepts)</p></li><li><p>Managing state with class-based components and React Hooks</p></li><li><p>How to output lists and conditional content</p></li><li><p>Styling of React components</p></li><li><p>A deep dive into the internals of React and advanced component features</p></li><li><p>How to access Http content from within React apps (AJAX)</p></li><li><p>Redux,&nbsp;Redux, Redux ... from basics to advanced!</p></li><li><p>Forms and form validation in React apps</p></li><li><p>Authentication</p></li><li><p>An introduction to unit testing</p></li><li><p>An introduction to Next.js</p></li><li><p>React app deployment instructions</p></li><li><p>...and much more!</p></li></ul>",

         "<p><em>Course updated in May 2019!</em></p><p>What do you use to <strong>understand Financial Markets?</strong> Are you adding indicators over indicators and you end up <strong>more confused than before?</strong> </p><p>What if I told you that you can analyze the markets with just <strong>one indicator?</strong> <br>What if I told you that you can turn one of the most complex indicators into a <strong>powerful and easy-to-use weapon to make money trading Financial Markets?</strong></p><p><strong>Welcome to Advanced Forex Trading - Ichimoku Trading Strategy Explained.</strong></p><p>My ultimate goal for this course is not to teach you another indicator that you can have on your chart. My goal is to provide you with a <strong>logical strategy</strong> that you can apply to trade the markets with confidence.</p><p>To achieve this goal, we first need to have a look at the <strong>Ichimoku Indicator</strong>. We will start with an introduction in order to familiarize with the complete indicator, then I will dedicate <strong>4</strong> <strong>entire Sections</strong> and <strong>12 entire lectures</strong> to each component of the Ichimoku. <br>You will not find a pre-packed set of rules to apply blindly, you will understand any single component of the Ichimoku, you will learn any single formula and the reasons why we trade it in a certain way. This allows you to understand <strong>when and how to use the Ichimoku Indicator</strong>, being able to differentiate between different market scenarios, finding the best opportunities to trade and make money trading the Forex Market.</p><p>Section 8 is entirely dedicated to <strong>Forex Market analysis</strong> using the whole indicator, so you can start to familiarize with all the techniques and methods that we have studied in the previous sections.</p><p>After that, we will have another important part of the strategy: <strong>Risk Management</strong>.</p><p>If you had the chance to enroll in one of my other courses, you know that I like to keep things real. A strategy that helps only to analyze the market, without having a deep focus on <strong>Stop Loss</strong> and <strong>Take Profit</strong>, is not a complete strategy for me. So, my promise is to give you a complete strategy with a whole Section about Entry and Exit points, in order to understand how to open and manage your trades.</p><p>As usual, when I publish a new course, I also open a new <strong>Live Forex Trading Account with real money</strong> to publish live trades in the course and update the results with the strategy. In addition, in the live trading section, you will also find info about all the Brokers that I use or have used in the past, so you will have my personal feedback for each one in case you want to create a new account to trade the Forex Market.</p><p>Almost all the examples provided in the course are about <strong>Forex Trading</strong>, but I am confident that you will find the material very useful for other <strong>Financial Markets</strong>, like <strong>Stock Trading</strong>, <strong>Cryptocurrency Trading</strong> and many others.</p><p>What else in this course?&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>You will learn from my&nbsp;<strong>11+ years of experience</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You have&nbsp;<strong>unlimited lifetime access at no extra costs</strong>.</p></li><li><p>You can join our&nbsp;<strong>Facebook group</strong>&nbsp;and share your opinion with the instructor and thousands of other students. This is a huge opportunity to accelerate your learning curve!&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>New lectures will be added</strong>&nbsp;to the course constantly at no extra cost to you!</p></li><li><p><strong>You can always ask for help</strong>, my support is well known in Udemy.</p></li><li><p><strong>30-day money back guarantee</strong>&nbsp;no questions asked.<br></p></li></ul><p>I like to say to my students that signing up for this course is like signing up for a gym membership. You have all the equipment, all the machines and a personal trainer ready to help you, but if you stay home, eating chips and watching television, you are not going to see any result, right? So, take your first step. Enroll in the course and let's start this journey together.</p><p>See you at the top :)</p>",

         "<p>This is the 3rd part in my Data Science and Machine Learning&nbsp;series on Deep Learning in Python. At this point, you already know a lot about neural networks and deep learning, including not just the basics like backpropagation, but how to improve it using modern techniques like momentum and adaptive learning rates. You've already written deep neural networks in <strong>Theano</strong> and <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, and you know how to run code using the GPU.</p><p>This course is all about how to use deep learning for&nbsp;<strong>computer vision</strong> using&nbsp;<strong>convolutional neural networks</strong>. These are the state of the art when it comes to&nbsp;<strong>image classification</strong> and they beat vanilla deep networks at tasks like MNIST.</p><p>In this course we are going to up the ante and look at the&nbsp;<strong>StreetView House Number (SVHN)&nbsp;</strong>dataset - which uses larger color images at various angles&nbsp;- so things are going to get tougher both computationally and in terms of the difficulty of the classification task. But we will show that convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are capable of handling the challenge!</p><p>Because&nbsp;<strong>convolution</strong> is such a central part of this type of neural network, we are going to go in-depth on this topic. It has more applications than you might imagine, such as&nbsp;<strong>modeling artificial organs</strong> like the pancreas and the heart. I'm going to show you how to build convolutional filters that can be applied to&nbsp;<strong>audio</strong>, like the echo effect, and I'm going to show you how to build filters for&nbsp;<strong>image effects,&nbsp;</strong>like the&nbsp;<strong>Gaussian blur&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>edge detection</strong>.</p><p>We will also do some&nbsp;<strong>biology</strong> and talk about how convolutional neural networks have been inspired by the&nbsp;<strong>animal visual cortex</strong>.</p><p>After describing the architecture of a convolutional neural network, we will jump straight into code, and I will show you how to extend the deep neural networks we built last time (in part 2)&nbsp;with just a few new functions to turn them into CNNs. We will then test their performance and show how convolutional neural networks written in both Theano and TensorFlow can outperform the accuracy of a plain neural network on the StreetView House Number dataset.</p><p>All the materials for this course are FREE. You can download and install Python, Numpy, Scipy, Theano, and TensorFlow with simple commands shown in previous courses.</p><p>This course focuses on '<strong>how to build and understand</strong>', not just 'how to use'. Anyone can learn to use an API in 15 minutes after reading some documentation. It's not about 'remembering facts', it's about&nbsp;<strong>'seeing for yourself' via experimentation</strong>. It will teach you how to visualize what's happening in the model internally. If you want&nbsp;<strong>more</strong>&nbsp;than just a superficial look at machine learning models, this course is for you.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Suggested Prerequisites:</p><ul><li><p>matrix addition and multiplication</p></li><li><p>Python coding: if/else, loops, lists, dicts, sets</p></li><li><p>Numpy coding: matrix and vector operations, loading a CSV file</p></li><li><p>Know the basic theory behind feedforward neural networks</p></li><li><p>Can write a feedforward neural network in Theano or TensorFlow</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>TIPS (for getting through the course):</p><ul><li><p>Watch it at 2x.</p></li><li><p>Take handwritten notes. This will drastically increase your ability to retain the information.</p></li><li><p>Write down the equations. If you don't, I guarantee it will just look like gibberish.</p></li><li><p>Ask lots of questions on the discussion board. The more the better!</p></li><li><p>Realize that most exercises will take you days or weeks to complete.</p></li><li><p>Write code yourself, don't just sit there and look at my code.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>WHAT&nbsp;ORDER&nbsp;SHOULD&nbsp;I&nbsp;TAKE&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;COURSES&nbsp;IN?:</p><ul><li><p>Check out the lecture 'What order should I take your courses in?' (available in the Appendix of any of my courses, including the free Numpy course)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
